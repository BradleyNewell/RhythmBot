# RhythmBot

The aim of this project is to generate random strumming patterns to assist with learning Rhythm Guitar.

There are 3 possible actions which are as follows:

D = Down Strum
U = Up Strum 
_ = No Strum

Currently it will only generate 4/4 time signature patterns meaning there will be an action on and off the beat.
An example of the output generated by this program would be:

DD_UU_D_

Which should be interpreted as:

[Down, Down, Pause, Up, Up, Pause, Down, Pause]
